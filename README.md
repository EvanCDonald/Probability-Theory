# Probability-Theory (Grad-level courses on probability theory)

I'm currently finishing up my PhD in mathematics (as of Fall 2021), specifically
in probability theory.  Unsurprisingly, I have found that teaching helps my
learning process.  So, I create some lecture content every now and then. I
intend to produce a full 2 year sequence worth of material following this
tentative progression: 

Course 1 - Probability space, random variables, expectation,
variance, independence, laws of large numbers, convergence in
distribution, characteristic functions, central limit theorems, 

Course 2-  discrete time stochastic processes, optional times,
stopping times, martingales, markov chains 

Course 3-continuus time processes, brownian motion, stochastic integration

Course 4- SDEs and further topics
